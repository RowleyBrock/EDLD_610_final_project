abstract: |
  Not only does a career promote financial independence, it can also provide an
  individual with confidence, self-determination, supportive relationships, and
  engagement within the community. A primary focus of the employment literature
  to date has been on strategies to improve employment readiness and the
  identification of factors that influence employment outcomes for students with
  disabilities.Thus, a gap has been identified between the preparedness of
  individuals with disabilities for competitive integrated employment and the
  willingness of employers to hire them. Therefore, it is necessary to better
  understand the perspectives of employers on individuals with disabilities in
  the workforce. Better understanding of this gap in knowledge will led to
  better outcomes for individuals with disabilities and more appropriate job
  matches, as well as leading to more positive perspectives on hiring
  individuals with disabilities on the part of employers.

Meaningful employment is one of the cornerstones of adult life and has been
identified as a critical need for individuals with disabilities
[@rogan2002vocational]. Not only does a career promote financial independence,
it can also provide an individual with confidence, self-determination,
supportive relationships, and engagement within the community. Research has
pointed to employment contributing to the development of positive and stable
identities, quality of life, and future career success and potential earnings
[@wagner2005after; @shandra2008school].

Despite this, research consistently demonstrates that employment rates for
individuals with disabilities fall significantly below those of individuals
without disabilities [@stapleton2003contrasting; @kaye2010impact;
@schur2013people]. Evidence from the @dohm2007occupational indicates that the
percentage of persons with disabilities who are employed was only 17.9 percent
as compared to 65.3 percent of persons without disabilities. These employment
disparities not only affect the economic well-being of individuals with
disabilities (e.g., low income levels and high poverty rates), but also their
social inclusion @krahn2011world. The 1990 Americans with Disabilities Act and
subsequent 2008 amendments, combined with the 2006 UN convention on the Rights
of Persons with Disabilities, is evidence that improving employment
opportunities for people with disabilities is an important goal in the United
States and around the world [@ameri2018disability].

While preparing individuals for employment has been a dominant theme of
secondary education and transition for more than two decades
[@wehmeyer2012introduction], there has been less emphasis placed on the
willingness of employers to hire individuals with disabilities. A primary focus
of the employment literature to date has been on strategies to improve
employment readiness and the identification of factors that influence employment
outcomes for students with disabilities. For example, @rabren2002predictors
identified the predictors of postschool employment for individuals with
disabilities and much of the research has focused on improving employment
readiness skills on behalf of students with disabilities as opposed to focused
on employers who should be considered an important stakeholder in this effort.

There have been some studies, however, that have examined the attitudes and
perspectives of employers and how they influence employment outcomes for
individuals with disabilities. @gilbride2003identification examined the
characteristics of employers who are open to hiring and supporting workers with
disabilities and found that even employers who were willing to hire individuals
with disabilities still had major concerns maintaining explicit and rigorous
hiring guidelines and felt that individuals with disabilities who didn’t meet
these criteria would not be considered for competitive employment positions. In
another study on employer perspectives, @houtenville2015employers, compared
hiring practices across industries and found that while employers were open to
hiring individuals with disabilities, there remained a concern about
outward-facing positions and whether or not customers were willing to be served
by or interact with individuals with disabilities. @morgan2005employer, in a
comparison study of employers with and without experience hiring individuals
with disabilities, found that while most were willing, those with prior
experience hiring and working with individuals with disabilities were more
comfortable hiring this demographic.

Among other factors, employers’ attitudes toward employees with disabilities is
an important influential factor in employment rates for individuals with
disabilities [@unger2002employers]. While positive employer attitudes may lead
to improved employment outcomes for individuals with disabilities,
discrimination or other negative attitudes may lead to employment barriers for
this population [@livermore2009review]. However, as evidenced from the above
literature, while there are some studies that have explored employer
perspectives toward hiring individuals with disabilities, much of the research
exists in niche areas and is both incomplete and out-of-date. Thus, a gap has
been identified between the preparedness of individuals with disabilities for
competitive integrated employment and the willingness of employers to hire them.
Therefore, it is necessary to better understand the perspectives of employers on
individuals with disabilities in the workforce. Better understanding of this gap
in knowledge will led to better outcomes for individuals with disabilities and
more appropriate job matches, as well as leading to more positive perspectives
on hiring individuals with disabilities on the part of employers.

# Methods
## Research Questions:  
>*a)* What states responded to the survey and at what rate?  
>*b)* How do employers rank, "Higher Order Skills" when hiring individuals with disabilities?  
>*c)* How do employers rank, "Personal Management Skills" when hiring individuals with disabilities?  
>*d)* How do employers rank, "Interpersonal Skills" when hiring individuals with disabilities?

A researcher-developed survey, comprised of questions targeting the hiring
practices and willingness of employers to hire individuals with disabilities was
used in this study. The survey was anticipated to take approximately 20 minutes
to complete.

Survey participants were contacted via email and asked to respond to an online
survey. Recruitment emails  included a recruitment statement and a link to the
survey, which was developed using online survey software called Qualtrics. The
survey was developed by the researchers conducting the current using previous
employer surveys described in prior studies [@ju2014employability;
@domzal2008survey] as an impetus for the survey and included additional
questions and necessary modifications in order to address the specific research
questions described above.

Our intent was to include relevant employers from across the country, generating
a sample representative of employers across all industries. We targeted
individuals who are responsible for or knowledgeable of the hiring practices at
their respective places of employment, though the specifics of this will be
unable to be confirmed. They may be managers, Human Resources representatives,
or others in charge of hiring. One simple analysis we conducted is a visual
representation (heatmap) of survey responses by states.

We used `r cite_r("r-references.bib")` for all our analyses. Given the
exploratory purpose of the study (i.e., to learn more about the perspectives of
employers toward hiring individuals with disabilities), analyses will be
primarily descriptive in nature. Initially, however, we will conduct a
confirmatory factor analysis to validate factor structures of employability
skills, basing the factor structures on a previous study (Ju et al., 2012; Ju et
al., 2014). Next, we will run descriptive statistics for survey items to explore
patterns among survey respondents. Logistic regression analyses will also be
computed to explore whether certain variables are predictive of employers’
responses to individual survey items. Structural equation modeling (e.g.,
exploratory factor analysis) may be used to identify the factor structure of
perceived characteristics of employers willing to hire individuals with
disabilities.

Preliminary work included some basic transformations as we move from raw to tidy
data. As we attempt to answer our research questions we decided it is best to
work with only a subset of the data. We filtered the data to better answer the
research questions. For example, we examined missing data and determined whether
we can consider that data is missing at random or if what we have is missing
data that needs to be coded as zero. We filtered our data to include only
employers who provided complete or near complete data. After we have transformed
our dataset we begin the process of visualization. This included, but not
limited to, examining bar charts, histograms, line charts and scatterplots using
_ggplot_. We also examined basic descriptive data (e.g., means, Standard
deviations, correlations, etc.). The visual and descriptive analysis helped
inform on possible data reduction approaches. For example, we reduced the number
of variables we examine by creating scales via exploratory and confirmatory
factor analysis.

# Results 

Exploratory data visualization strategies provided valuable information regarding employer perspectives. 

We modeled the number of surveys retured by each state's political affiliation
(republican and democrat) percentage `r results$full_result$modelfit$r2`. The
estimate, centered on the average republican percentage by each individaul
state, found `r results$full_result$repc` No significant evidence exists that
political affiliation has any effect on the number of responses to this survey,
retured by individual states.
\newpage

# Discussion

We were fairly certain that republican dominated states would return
significantly less responses to a survery involving individuals with
disabilities. We are still shocked that nothing significant was discovered
during this fishing expedition. Perhaps, some research bias was induced by a
party affiliation that would stand behind these discriminatory actions?
