# Course repo
## Here's what we still need for the final project
* data from messy to tidy
* two exploratory data visualizations
* summary statistics of the data in tables
* a bit of writing in each (abstract, intro, methods, results, discussion, references)
* ?? more stuff we don't know aoubt yet ??

## Added Monday, 10/21:
* employer.sav data file: opening in SPSS will allow you to see variable labels which are much more helpful than variable names at this point
* IRB determination with research plan (RQs 2 and 5 will be most relevant for our purposes) and survey as an attachment
